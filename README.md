Predicting Online News popularity

The widespread advent and usage of smart phones has made online news one of the most consumed form of news. Online news has become very popular. Predicting the popularity of online news has been one of the popular topics for research.  There are various stakeholders involved which get affected and desire for the prediction of online news popularity. Stakeholders like advertisement and marketing agencies which can design their strategies based on the predictions, readers can also sort out articles they want to read based on the popularity index .

One way of identifying the news popularity is through the number of clicks, number of shares or how many times the news has been searched on the search engines or collecting data like how many times a particular news is shared , liked or commented on. This information can be collected through the news websites.

In my paper, I am considering the number of shares as the variable which will define the index of popularity and will be used for predicting the popularity of the online news.

There are various other variables which have been collected in the dataset like the type of news, the number of videos in a news article, the number of images in the news article and many more which will be listed out when I describe the various attributes.

Predicting the online news popularity is a difficult and complex task and different predicting methods have been proposed here. Predicting how an online news in future will get popular will be used to create a new revenue model for the various advertisers,
for content writers and for people like politicians who would like to influence their voters.
